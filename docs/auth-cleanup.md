# Authentication System Cleanup

This document outlines the steps needed to clean up the development-specific authentication system before deploying to production.

## Development Authentication Components

The following components were created specifically for development and testing purposes:

1. **Mock Authentication System**
   - File: `/src/lib/auth/mock-auth.ts`
   - Purpose: Provides a localStorage-based authentication system for development
   - Contains test user accounts and passwords

2. **Development Login Endpoint**
   - File: `/src/app/api/auth/dev-login/route.ts`
   - Purpose: API endpoint for direct login in development mode
   - Bypasses normal authentication flow

3. **Test Account Buttons**
   - File: `/src/components/auth/test-account-buttons.tsx`
   - Purpose: Quick access buttons for test accounts on the sign-in page
   - Only displayed in development mode

4. **Development Mode Middleware Bypass**
   - File: `/src/middleware.ts`
   - Purpose: Bypasses authentication checks in development mode
   - Allows access to protected routes without authentication

## Cleanup Steps

Before deploying to production, follow these steps:

1. **Remove Mock Authentication System**
   ```bash
   rm src/lib/auth/mock-auth.ts
   ```

2. **Remove Development Login Endpoint**
   ```bash
   rm src/app/api/auth/dev-login/route.ts
   ```

3. **Remove Test Account Buttons Component**
   ```bash
   rm src/components/auth/test-account-buttons.tsx
   ```

4. **Update Sign-in Form**
   - Remove imports and references to mock authentication
   - Remove development-specific login code
   - Remove test account buttons from the UI

5. **Update Middleware**
   - Remove development mode bypass
   - Ensure all routes are properly protected

6. **Update Dashboard Page**
   - Remove mock user handling
   - Ensure proper Supabase authentication checks

## Test Accounts

For reference, the following test accounts were created for development:

| Account Type | Email | Password | Role |
|-------------|-------|----------|------|
| Developer | developer@example.com | developer123 | developer |
| Analytics Developer | analytics_dev@example.com | analytics123 | developer |
| Tester | tester@example.com | tester123 | tester |
| Admin | admin@example.com | admin123 | admin |

**IMPORTANT**: These accounts should not be used in production. Proper user accounts should be created through the Supabase authentication system.

## Security Considerations

The development authentication system bypasses normal security measures and should never be deployed to production. It is designed solely for local development and testing purposes.

In production:
- Always use Supabase authentication
- Implement proper session management
- Use secure password hashing
- Implement rate limiting for login attempts
- Consider adding multi-factor authentication for sensitive accounts
