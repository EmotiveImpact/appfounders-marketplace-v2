# Dashboard Enhancement Plan

This document outlines the plan to enhance all dashboard interfaces to fully utilize the analytics features we've built.

## Current Status

### Developer Dashboard
- Basic overview with minimal stats
- Simple app listing
- Limited navigation to other features
- Missing integration with analytics API

### Analytics Dashboard
- Has comprehensive charts and metrics
- Time-range filtering
- Includes overview metrics, charts, and app performance
- Not fully connected to real data sources

### Other Dashboards
- Tester Dashboard: Minimal implementation
- Admin Dashboard: Minimal implementation
- Super Admin Dashboard: Not implemented
